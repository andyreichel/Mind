Limitations:
-Comments are included in loc changed
-repos file large files take a very long time to clone. This is a restriction of jgit: http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jgit-dev/msg00689.html


Lessons learned:
- Sonar Web Api for Timemachine does not provide the historical data in a
file-specific base. That means that the data has to be collected after each sonar run.
- Development of Sonar Java Api will not be continued thats why we should use Web Api
-Resources set in two different versions differ
-Sonar Webapi cannot list all rules of a language so we have to specify all rulerepositories in a configfile

Conditions:
-Versions in Sonar have the same name as the branch in git

Tasks:
Make everything open source.

Key Decisions:
Question: In what frequency is the software being used
criteria: execution time
options: Running it as part of continuous integration
		Running it once to get the priority of rules
rational: Because the software is used to prioritize the rules over
a large timespan it is not necessary to run it in each building cycle thats why it is chosen
to design it as a run-once application.
